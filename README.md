# Photo Catalog - Frontend

### _The "Photo Catalog" application is my first project where I created both frontend and backend. The frontend was built using React.

## Application Components:
Frontend: React, using useState for state management.

## Features: 
Without Logging In: Ability to browse the catalog and filter items.
Logged-In User: Ability to edit items.
Administrator: Full access to all features.
Sample Items: The application suggests loading sample items if all existing ones are deleted.

## âš™ Setup
To run the program from the 'currency-converter-react' repository on your local computer, you can follow these steps:
1. <b>Downloading the source code:</b><br>
Clone the repository from the GitHub page to your local computer using the command:
```commandline
     git clone https://github.com/mariuszmmm/photo-catalog.git
```
2. <b>Dependency Installation:</b><br>
Navigate to the project directory, then install all required dependencies using a package manager like npm:
```commandline
    cd photo-catalog
    npm install
```
3. <b>Launching the Application:</b><br>
After installing the dependencies, you can run the application locally. Use the command:
```commandline
    npm start
```
  This command will start the application in developer mode, opening it in a browser at http://localhost:3000.
